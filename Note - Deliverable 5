****For Email *****

Inorder for the email functionality to work we need to make changes to the following lines in the below specified files:

1. Navigation: Xampp Folder -> sendmail folder->sendmail.ini file
Change the following lines in sendmail.ini file:

smtp_server=smtp.gmail.com
smtp_port=587
smtp_ssl=tls

auth_username= medanytimeonline2019@gmail.com
auth_password=medanytime123

force_sender= medanytimeonline2019@gmail.com

hostname= localhost

2. Navigation: Xampp Folder -> Php -> search for php.ini file -> in that file search for keyword sendmail_path

Set the path for that sendmail_path variable as:

sendmail_path = C:\xampp\sendmail\sendmail.exe

3. Restart the xampp after making changes to these files.
